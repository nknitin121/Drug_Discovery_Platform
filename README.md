# Drug_Discovery_Platform
AI-Powered Drug Discovery Platform is a machine learning–based system that predicts whether a drug compound is Active or Inactive against a target protein. It uses physicochemical drug–protein features, data preprocessing, SMOTE balancing, and multiple ML models to enable faster, cost-effective early-stage drug discovery.
